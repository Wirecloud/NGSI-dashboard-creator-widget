This widget allows you to interactively configure a dashboard for NGSI data visualization.

This widget receives information from a CKAN-metadata-operator and, upon this, makes some initial quieries of the data and displays a build panel for adding data visualizations to a dashboard.

This widget is expected to form part of the public dashboard to be linked with the CKAN visualziation extension WireCloud view.
